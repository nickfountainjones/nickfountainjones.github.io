      <p>
        Dr. Nick Fountain-Jones is a lecturer in public health with a focus on 
        evolutionary disease ecology and One Health. He integrates methods 
        in epidemiology, ecology, and genomics to understand how pathogens 
        emerge and evolve, and how these processes affect wildlife, 
        livestock, and human health.

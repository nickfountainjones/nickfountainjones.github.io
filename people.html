        <h3>Talia Brav-Cubitt</h3>
        <p>
        Talia is a PhD student studying wildlife pathogen transmission using genomic and epigenetic data, with study systems including Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease, and viruses in seabirds in the Southern Ocean. Talia is from Auckland, New Zealand and previously worked as a research technician in the Ecological Genetics Lab at Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research. She has broad interests in using molecular tools to answer questions in conservation biology and disease ecology.

        <h3>Eva Baukes</h3>
        <p>
          Eva is an Honours student investigating mosquito distributions in Northeastern Tasmania, focusing on Culex annulirostris, a key vector of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Her research integrates molecular genetics, taxonomic identification, and virome analysis to assess species composition and arbovirus presence. Eva completed a Bachelor of Science majoring in Zoology through UTAS and has broad interests in disease ecology, vector-borne diseases, and the application of molecular tools in conservation biology and public health. Her work contributes to One Health initiatives by improving understanding of vector distributions and informing evidence-based health policies.

        <h3>Tengyi Mai</h3>
        <p>
          Tengyi is a PhD student doing spatiotemporal modelling of transmissible cancers of Tasmania devils, especially on the ecological, epidemiological and evolutionary interaction between Devil Facial Tumor Disease (DFTD) and Devil Facial Tumor 2 (DFT2). Tengyi comes from statistic and economics background and has years of working experience as data scientist with Python and machine learning. He is keen to apply mathematical modelling skills to the research of epidemiology and ecology.

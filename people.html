      <h3>Dr. Nick Fountain-Jones</h3>
      <p>
        Dr. Nick Fountain-Jones is a lecturer in public health with a focus on 
        evolutionary disease ecology and One Health. He integrates methods 
        in epidemiology, ecology, and genomics to understand how pathogens 
        emerge and evolve, and how these processes affect wildlife, 
        livestock, and human health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nick’s research spans a variety of species and ecosystems, 
        often with a goal of informing evidence-based conservation 
        and health management strategies. Through cross-disciplinary 
        collaborations, he has contributed to a deeper understanding 
        of disease transmission and evolution in a changing world.

        <h3>Talia Brav-Cubitt</h3>
        <p>
          Talia is a PhD student studying wildlife pathogen transmission using genomic 
          and epigenetic data, with study systems including Tasmanian devil facial tumour 
          disease, and viruses in seabirds in the Southern Ocean. Talia is from Auckland, 
          New Zealand and previously worked as a research technician in the Ecological 
          Genetics Lab at Manaaki Whenua – Landcare Research. She has broad interests 
          in using molecular tools to answer questions in conservation biology and disease ecology.

        <img src="images/Laura.JPG" alt="Laura Patier" />
        <h3>Laura Patier</h3>
        <p>
          Laura is a PhD student studying pathogens in wildlife, focusing on Antarctic marine predators and Australian seabirds systems. Her research looks at viromes and microbiomes using new-generation sequencing methods. Laura is from France and comes from a marine ecology background, previously investigating mercury contamination in seabirds. She’s interested in the use of molecular tools and metagenomics to deepen our understanding of disease ecology in wildlife.

        <img src="images/Eva.jpg" alt="Eva Baukes" />
        <h3>Eva Baukes</h3>
        <p>
          Eva is an Honours student investigating mosquito distributions in Northeastern 
          Tasmania, focusing on <em>Culex annulirostris</em>, a key vector of the Japanese 
          encephalitis virus (JEV). Her research integrates molecular genetics, taxonomic 
          identification, and virome analysis to assess species composition and arbovirus presence. 
          Eva completed a Bachelor of Science majoring in Zoology at UTAS and has broad interests 
          in disease ecology, vector-borne diseases, and the application of molecular tools 
          in conservation biology and public health. Her work contributes to One Health 
          initiatives by improving understanding of vector distributions and informing 
          evidence-based health policies.

        <img src="images/Tengyi.jpg" alt="Tengyi Mai" />
        <h3>Tengyi Mai</h3>
        <p>
          Tengyi is a PhD student doing spatiotemporal modelling of transmissible cancers 
          of Tasmanian devils, especially on the ecological, epidemiological, and evolutionary 
          interaction between Devil Facial Tumor Disease (DFTD) and Devil Facial Tumor 2 (DFT2). 
          Tengyi comes from a statistics and economics background and has years of working 
          experience as a data scientist with Python and machine learning. He is keen to 
          apply mathematical modelling skills to the research of epidemiology and ecology.
